    "description": """
        This module enhances the standard invoice functionality in Odoo by:
        - Adding a dynamic attachment number for each invoice line section.
        - Generating attachment links for each attachment number.
        - Enabling users to click the attachment number to navigate directly to the corresponding attachment.
        The actual content of the attachment is not relevantâ€”this module only implements the navigation logic.
